State the problem/issue to resolve Youtube audios are not downloadable without Youtube Premium. We decided to create a program that lets you download these audio files for free.

If applicable, briefly survey previous works if any (include references) A site that has a similar idea as us: https://ytmp3.cc/e87c/ We can improve on the UI Less Ads Make it look less sketchy/clean up any text

If applicable, describe assumptions / operating environments / intended usage Using IntelliJ (Java), Git, possibly making a website with HTML/CSS

High-level description of your solution which may include (but is not limited to), your plan and approach. Be as specific as possible. Accept a YouTube link as user input (error handling for input) Utilizing either a library or implementing our own code to download the Youtube video Converting downloaded video to .mp3 format (using JAVE or FFmpeg Java libraries) Embed a player onto our website with a prompt to play the .MP3 file Documentation and possibly deployment on a server

Functionality: describe how your solution tackles the issues Our solution provides a direct answer to the issue by simply asking the user for the YouTube link and providing a seamless way for them to download and play the audio that is desired.

Operations: List operations for each intended user (in list format). Be precise and specific.

Users Input YouTube links in input field Click on a “convert” button to start the conversion process Click on a link/button to play the mp3 file on our site Download the mp3 player on their own computer

Admins Configure the application (Setup file storage location, error handling, UI) Monitor app (Any errors during conversion or playback, resource usage on the site) Maintain app (Update any dependencies, fix any user-reported bugs, increase website performance)
